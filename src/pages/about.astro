          I'm an engineer who focuses on building practical, maintainable systems. I prefer simple solutions over complex ones and choose tools based on fit rather than popularity. I have a strong background in infrastructure, automation, and troubleshooting, with an emphasis on reducing operational friction. My approach is hands-onâ€”digging into problems, finding the root cause, and making things work reliably. I believe good infrastructure isn't just about uptime but also about being understandable and manageable.

          Outside of technology, I'm passionate about music, video games, movies, and aesthetics/fashion. 
          I enjoy exploring how these different domains can inspire and influence technical work, whether through design, storytelling, or way-of-thinking.
